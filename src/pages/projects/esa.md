MOVE ABOVE: The European Space Agency | Business Applications were looking to gain a 70% increase in grant applications in the UK.


Calibre were put forward by ESAs Visual Storytelling Studio - Nucco Brain, because we could deliver UX research, onboard a Drupal developer, and work with enterprise-grade development environments.

By the end of the project, we achieved XXXXX

>“Calibre was able to make the project look simple and approachable to external stakeholders, whilst delivering a UX-driven and technically complex project under the hood. There aren’t many studios that could be as flexible and dynamic as Calibre.“

## Highlights

### User Research
**When there’s too many good ideas to manage, turn to UX data and then build a strategy.**
To bring clarity on what needed to be improved, we started by recording user interviews and sorting the insights into the highest impact, lowest effort changes we could make on the website.

Thanks to our rapid prototyping and feedback processes, our wireframes received input from engineering, copywriting, design, and marketing, which meant full stakeholder buy-in to a solution that would get the key messages across to our users

### Visual Storytelling
**When you’re designing for a brand like the Space Agency, let people aspire to be part of the story**
In the process of extending their (print) brand guidelines into web to redesign their website, we jumped on a bigger opportunity.

We collaborated with Nucco Brain (their Visual Storytelling Studio) to incorporate stylised illustrations instead of photography, thereby tapping into an age-old storytelling technique to invite the user to imagine themselves being part of the story. This is particularly valuable when you’re an aspirational brand like the space agency, and your strategic goal is encourage more people to apply for grant applications.


### Collaboration
**When collaborating with 5 other companies, clear communication and reporting is critical**
As boring as reporting may sound, it gets pretty important on a project with 27 stakeholders. For a project like this, it’s crucial to identify the main point of contact at each company, the core stakeholders, and the wider stakeholders.

From there on, clear communication requires a consistent format, vocabulary, and project plan. People can more easily keep on top of what’s going on if you cut the noise out of a message.


> ### Calibre Tip (on UX Research)
> Redesign this blue line section
> If you’re carrying out user research, you get a statistically significant enough sample by testing with just 5 users.
> There’s some clever stats behind it, outlined in this InVision article. We recommend reading it if you want to understand why, or know when your particular case calls for a different number of users to test with.
