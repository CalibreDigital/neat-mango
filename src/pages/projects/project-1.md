Subutai was building version 4 of their product, and it had to transform the company from no revenue to a profitable business.

They chose Calibre because our bespoke proposal drew from our experience with architecture, product design, devops workflow, cybersecurity, and effective team coaching.

## About Subutai

Subutai was an InsurTech startup that raised funding nearly a year prior. Their first cybersecurity product scanned millions of data points to generate visualisations on the fly, and was used to determine the risk profile of an enterprise from an insurance perspective.

## When the Product and Engineering aren’t communicating well, create a language they both understand.

With such a complex product, the product and the engineering lead were imagining different things whenever they discussed how it should work. This was why the last three versions of the product weren’t quite commercially usable by the time they were built.

By shifting their conversation from user needs to final design solutions, we coached the team to create a UI design specification that solved all of the challenges in one product.

## When code changes take too much effort to implement, it’s time to refactor it.

We noticed the engineering challenges were unnecessecarily complicated and the team needed a more modular architecture - one that separated the dependencies and allowed developers to work on one part of the system without breaking things elsewhere.

Instead of designing a new architecture for them, we just asked them to replacing their bespoke query language with GraphQL. We knew GraphQL would structure their codebase for them, and therefore make it possible to work on one part of the codebase without having to consider the impact elsewhere.

## When you don’t know the answer, find someone that does.

Once the team implemented a modular architecture, we were able to efficiently start solving engineering challenges across differnet modules. To speed things up further, we reached out to a network of niche experts who had faced similar problems before. We soon coordinated with:

An **Elasticsearch expert** to efficiently scan millions of data points.

A **React.js** developer to build a new frontend.

A **DevOps** studio for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
